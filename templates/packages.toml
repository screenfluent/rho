# Additional Pi Packages
# Add third-party extensions and skills here.
# Run `rho sync` after editing to install and activate.
#
# Each [[packages]] entry needs at minimum a `source` field.
# Optional `extensions` and `skills` arrays filter what loads.

# ── Examples ────────────────────────────────────────────

# Install an npm package (all extensions and skills):
# [[packages]]
# source = "npm:package-name"

# Install from git with filtering:
# [[packages]]
# source = "git:github.com/user/repo"
# extensions = ["extensions/specific.ts"]  # Only load this extension
# skills = ["skills/specific"]             # Only load this skill
