# Location

## Get current location
```bash
termux-location                    # default (GPS if available)
termux-location -p gps             # GPS only (more accurate, slower)
termux-location -p network         # Network only (faster, less accurate)
termux-location -p passive         # Last known location (instant)
```

## Request single update (default)
```bash
termux-location -r once
```

## Continuous updates
```bash
termux-location -r updates         # keep updating until killed
```

## Output format
