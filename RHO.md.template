# RHO Checklist

Periodic check-in reminders for the agent.

## Quick Scan

- [ ] Any urgent messages or notifications I should see?
- [ ] Any failed commands or errors from recent operations?
- [ ] Any long-running tasks that finished?

## Active Work

- [ ] Any TODOs or FIXMEs in the code we just edited?
- [ ] Are there open questions I haven't answered?
- [ ] Any files left unsaved or uncommitted changes?

## Follow-ups

- [ ] Any background tasks to check on?
- [ ] Any research or searches I asked for that haven't been reported?

## Session Health

- [ ] Is the context getting long? Should we `/compact`?
- [ ] Are there old branches in `/tree` that should be cleaned up?
