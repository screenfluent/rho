# RHO Checklist

Periodic check-in reminders for the agent.

## Bootstrap (One-time setup)

- [ ] **SOUL.md SEEDING**: If SOUL.md is still the blank template, run the `soul-update` skill in `bootstrap` mode to interview the user and fill it in. This must happen in an interactive session, not a heartbeat.

## Scheduled Tasks

- Recurring tasks live in `HEARTBEAT.md` (see HEARTBEAT.md.template)

## Quick Scan

- [ ] Any urgent messages or notifications I should see?
- [ ] Any failed commands or errors from recent operations?
- [ ] Any long-running tasks that finished?
- [ ] Any unreviewed soul proposals in `~/.rho/soul-proposals.md`?

## Active Work

- [ ] Any TODOs or FIXMEs in the code we just edited?
- [ ] Are there open questions I haven't answered?
- [ ] Any files left unsaved or uncommitted changes?

## Follow-ups

- [ ] Any background tasks to check on?
- [ ] Any research or searches I asked for that haven't been reported?

## Session Health

- [ ] Is the context getting long? Should we `/compact`?
- [ ] Are there old branches in `/tree` that should be cleaned up?

**Note:** This file is read on every heartbeat. Keep it concise.
If both this file and `HEARTBEAT.md` are empty (only headers), heartbeats will be skipped to save API calls.
