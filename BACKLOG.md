# Rho Product Backlog

> Managed by heartbeat PM cycle. Updated by agent, reviewed by human.
> Engineering subagents pull work from **Ready** and report back here.

## In Progress

_(none)_

## Ready (Prioritized)
- [ ] **Smart heartbeat routing** — Heartbeat uses cheapest available model, not user's primary model. Leverage `resolveSmallModel`. Document cost advantage vs OpenClaw ($0.001/heartbeat vs $0.75). **P1**
- [ ] **iPhone/Termius support** — SSH-friendly tmux config (mouse on, reduced escape-time, mobile status bar). Termius setup guide. Oracle Cloud free tier guide. See `~/notes/research/iphone-termius-strategy.md`. **P1**
- [ ] **Landing site updates** — Add iPhone/Termius section. "Use your existing subscription" messaging. Cost comparison vs OpenClaw. Provider logos. **P1**
- [ ] **Fix README diagram** — GitHub issue #1. Formatting broken on agent loop diagram. **P1** _(likely resolved by cross-platform README rewrite — verify after push)_
- [ ] **Landing site in repo** — Move `~/projects/rho-site/` into repo or separate repo. Set up CI deploy to Cloudflare Pages. **P1**
- [ ] **Install redirect** — Update bootstrap.sh to use `curl -fsSL https://runrho.dev/install | bash` as canonical URL. **P1**
- [ ] **/tasks command** — Lightweight task queue extension. See TODO.md for spec. **P2**

## Icebox

- [ ] **Trusted Extension Registry** — Workers + R2 + D1. Publish/search/install extensions. Security scanning on publish (AST analysis). Author signing (Ed25519 + GitHub identity). Permission manifests. Public trust scores. The core product. See `~/notes/research/extension-ecosystem-exploration.md` + `~/notes/research/openclaw-ecosystem-intel.md`. **P2**
- [ ] **Extension Sync** — Push/pull extensions across devices. Free: manual. Pro: auto-sync on heartbeat. Concept: `~/notes/research/extension-sync-concept.md`. **P2**
- [ ] **Extension gallery** — Public browse page at runrho.dev/extensions. Depends on registry. **P3**
- [ ] **Brain sync** — Bundles into Pro tier. Not standalone. **P3**
- [ ] **Web dashboard** — View brain, heartbeat history. Depends on sync API. **P3**
- [ ] **Semantic memory search** — Vectorize integration for brain queries. **P3**
- [ ] **launchd/systemd service files** — Auto-start on macOS/Linux. Cross-platform v2. **P3**
- [ ] **Desktop UI automation** — AppleScript/xdotool extensions. Cross-platform v2. **P3**
- [ ] **Extension marketplace (paid)** — Premium extensions, revenue share. Needs user base (500+ stars). **P3**

## Done

- [x] **`rho login` command** — `rho login` opens pi's OAuth flow, `--status` shows providers, `--logout` removes creds. 7 acceptance tests pass. **P0** — 2026-02-05
- [x] **Cross-platform refactor** — All 10 steps completed. macOS/Linux/Android platforms, OS-aware install.sh, config support, setup scripts, README rewrite. 13 local commits. Ralph loop: 17 iterations, 27m. **P0** — 2026-02-05
- [x] **MIT license** — Added LICENSE file to repo root. **P0** — 2026-02-04
